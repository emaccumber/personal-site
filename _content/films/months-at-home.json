    "description": "An exploration of the tangled digital connections that comprise everyday life. Performed as part of Playing House's inaugural installation series.\n\n\"Inspired by the artist's frustration in constantly searching for adapters while traveling in different countries, the live performance is based on an intricately woven structure consisting of cables, LEDs and other electronic components, a literal and metaphorical exploration of a 'circuit' in contemporary lives.\""
