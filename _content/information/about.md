title: About Ethan MacCumber
---

I am a photographer and filmmaker based in San Francisco, California. My work explores the intersection of landscape, memory, and the human experience, with a focus on capturing fleeting moments and emotional resonance in both urban and natural environments.

Through my photography, I seek to document the subtle interplay between light, form, and atmosphere, often gravitating toward scenes that evoke a sense of contemplation or temporal awareness. My film projects extend this inquiry by incorporating movement and sound, creating immersive narratives that blur the lines between documentary and poetic expression.

I received my MFA in Visual Arts from UC San Diego and have exhibited work in galleries across the United States and Europe. When not creating my own work, I teach workshops on experimental photography techniques and documentary filmmaking.
